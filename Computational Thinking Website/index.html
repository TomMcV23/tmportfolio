    <h1>Introduction to Computational Thinking</h1>
    <section>
    <p>Computational thinking is the process of taking tasks that a computer needs to carry out and breaking them down so that the developer knows what to tell the computer to do. This then allows for solutions to be created that both the developer/people and the computer can both understand.
        The main techniques used in computational thinking are as follows:
        </p> 
        <ul class=def>
            <li>Decomposition: Decomposition is used to allow for the person in question to break down the current problem in to smaller tasks or issues that can be easy to fix.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pattern Recognition: This is where the smaller problems are examined for similarities to see if any of the problems share a common issue or if multiple problems could possibly benefit from the same solution.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Abstraction: Abstraction is where the most important information is gathered and examined to allow for information that serves no purpose to the problem currently being looked at to be avoided.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Algorithms: Algorithms allow for a step-by-step solution to be created that can then be used for the current problem or shared to other people with the same or similar issue. Algorithms may also just be a set of rules that need to be followed to ensure that the problem is solved. </li>
            <br>
        </ul>

    <p>Computational Thinking is very important in my current studies of Computing as it allows for a simple approach to problem solving while also giving me a way to understand what steps must be taken when first starting a project to help plan the features that need to be implemented as well as what needs to be done to accomplish them. </p>
    <p>In my future career it may be very important for the same reasons but could also be applied to problems outside of Computing as a result of computational thinking basically being a clear and easy to follow guide to problem solving. As well as helping other people with their problems with programming it can also be applied to generic computer errors such as crashes or error messages in helping to find a fix. </p>
