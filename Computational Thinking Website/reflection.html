        <p>During the short time with the Computational thinking unit there are many concepts and tools that I have learned about that I think will be of a great benefit in my further studies as well as beyond.</p>
        <p>The first topic that I learned in this unit was the very basics of HTML and CSS. This included what tags exist, what each one does as well as when they should be used over other tags. For example divs can be used to separate content but they have no meaning where as a section or article tag could allow for extra meaning to be given to the content that it is wrapped around. This basic understanding of HTML and CSS can be translated into my further studies for any projects that require web development or the basics of programming problem solving.</p>
        <p>Another topic that I learned during my time studying this unit is the basics of number systems. This entailed learning about binary, hexadecimal, octal and base10. Counting and converting between the number systems was taught with exercises given to reinforce the material taught. This can be taken further into my future studies and beyond as these number systems are used for a wide rage of purposes. Such as hexadecimal being used for the creation of error messages to detail the memory location of the errors or for binary being the basic form of communication with a computer system.</p>
        <p>The final topic that I learned about during the computational thinking unit was the basics of programming. This covered the very basic concepts of  programming that are shared between all of the programming languages that are currently available and are widely used. This topic covered the basic elements used in every programming languages such as, variables, statements, expressions,  conditions, iteration, pseudocode and commenting. These concepts are very important and can be taken further into my studies by allowing me to understand the basics of each programming language available . It also allows for problem solving to be made a bit simpler with pseudo code allowing for the tasks required to be written out in almost plain English then converting this pseudo code into actual code bit by bit until the code can be written and understood in the programming language of choice.</p>
        <p>All of these topics allow me to carry on my studies with a wide range of new knowledge into programming, web development and a general understanding of how computer systems are made, maintained and work.</p>
