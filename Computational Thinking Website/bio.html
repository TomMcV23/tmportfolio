    <p>Whitfield Diffie was born on the fifth of June 1944. Today he is known as the person that discovered the concept of public key cryptography. He studied mathematics in MIT and graduated in the year 1965 when he was 21. After graduating with a bachelors degree in mathematics he was hired by the MITRE corporation, where he stayed until 1969. He then joined Stanford Universities AI lab to work with the labs director, John McCarthy, where he helped work on proof of correctness of computer programs. During 1972 Whitfield Diffie’s changed his research to focus around cryptography.</p> 
    <p>He then took a leave of absence from the University in 1973, to pursue his newfound interest in cryptography. He travelled around the United States of America before returning to Stanford University with the support of Martin Hellman, an electrical engineering professor that was also pursuing research in the same field of cryptography. </p>
    <p>Diffie and Hellman both worked together until 1975 when they were joined by another person with interests in cryptography, this being Ralph Merkle, who joined them in 1976. They published a paper called “New Directions in Cryptography” in November of 1976. The details of this paper helped launch secure transactions on the internet allowing for e-commerce to flourish as well as the sending and receiving of encrypted files over the internet to anyone in any location.</p>

    <p>Whitfield Diffie’s work in cryptography transformed the internet into what it is today and allowed for a wide range of transactions to be made, allowing for money to be sent between locations, files to be sent over email all with out the risk of these transactions being intercepted and read as they would be encrypted before reaching the intended recipient. His work in cryptography also allowed for further developments to be made.</p>
    <p>Since publishing this paper he went on to work at Sun Microsystems in 1991 as a distinguished engineer and remained as Sun fellow and chief security officer until the 2009. Since 2009 he has worked as an advisor to start up companies in the security sector. In 2015, Diffie received the Turing award and two years later in 2017 he was elected to join the National Academy of Engineering.</p>
